# Usage

Github markdown does not support JavaScript links, so you'll have to bookmark them manually. To use the script, add a bookmark with the raw code as an URL to your browser bar.

Note that bookmarklets for testing pages on the fly may not work until you allow pop-ups for the page's domain.

## Inurl-search-results-in-the-textarea

To use this bookmarklet, first go to any page with the origin https://www.google.com/. Then click the bookmark and fill the input fields. As a search query, you can submit a string with white spaces: it would mean that all the words should be found in URLs. 

If you press the Search button, you'll get one easy-to-copy list of URLs from all the result pages. When the script runs, you may need to pass the reCAPTCHA challenge. Then the script execution will be interrupted, and you'll have to run it again.

## Nofollow-Sponsored-UGC-highlighter

On the page whose links you want to check, click the bookmarklet. All *nofollow* links should turn yellow; *dofollow* should become green. UGC or Sponsored links should have orange or red borders.

# Usage
Github markdown does not support JavaScript links, so you'll have to bookmark them manually: add a bookmark with the raw code as an URL to your browser bar.

Note that bookmarklets for testing pages on the fly may not work until you allow pop-ups for the page's domain.

**Inurl-search-results-in-the-textarea**: to use the bookmarklet, first go to any page whose origin is *https://www.google.com/*.
Then click the bookmarklet button and fill the input fields. As a search query you can submit a string with spaces: 
it would mean that all the words should be found in the URL. When you run the script, you'll get one easy-to-copy list of URLs from all the result pages.
